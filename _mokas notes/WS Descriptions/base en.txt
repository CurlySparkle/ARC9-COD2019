After many months of working into this, it's finally here on the workshop, weapons from [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2000950/Call_of_Duty_Modern_Warfare/] MW2019 [/url] to ARC9. Many efforts put into this to look decent as possible, while having to struggle with the limitations of this base was really annoying, so instead of throwing it away why not just release it so at least people can enjoy it, so here it is, anyways i hope you guys still like it or not and see you on the next year!

For those who are wondering, this is not meant to be a better or superior version to MWB. The only difference with this one is the focus on more customization provided by ARC9.
