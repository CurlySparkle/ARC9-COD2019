# [ARC9] Call of Duty: Modern Warfare
Weapon pack from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019) with only their vanilla base blueprints (but there's a few exceptions). There might be a lot of changes here and there in order to keep a proper balance on the weapons so they don't end up being extremely OP and have a better feeling of using them all.


If you want to make any improvements or better changes for this, feel free to make a PR (Pull Request).
