# ARC9-COD2019
An ARC9 version of the Modern Warfare 2019 weapons with only their vanilla base blueprints (with a few exceptions ofc) there might be alot of changes here and there mostly to keep a proper balance on the weapons so they dont end up being extremely op and have a better feeling of using them all.

Might require GSR to work as most of its extra attachments and extra sounds are from there, you can get it here
https://github.com/CurlySparkle/ARC9-GSR

If you want to make any improvements or better changes on the balance you can do so by doing a PR. (Pull Request)

As obvious this requires ARC9 to use these goodies that you can download here: https://github.com/HaodongMo/ARC-9
