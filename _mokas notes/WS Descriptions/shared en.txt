Adds most (but not all) the "global" attachments from [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2000950/Call_of_Duty_Modern_Warfare/] MW2019 [/url] for the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3127584298] [ARC9] CoD MW2019 [/url] pack. This pack includes muzzles, grips, stocks, and much more.

As it's said previously, this may not include literally all of the attachments/blueprints for some weapons, but will probably be added eventually (when I'm still have enough motivation to do it, ARC9 does bring quite a brain struggle). Either way, you can take a look at the files themselves to see how they work and you can implement your weapons using this shared pack.

This pack also supports localizations, but it is currently work-in-progress. Support languages are, and will be:
